# TodoList

That is a project that I created to study Nx, Angular, NestJS and Flutter.

# NestJS
I created a API using NestJS with CRUD and Auth functionality, using bcrypt to cryptograph the user password and Passport to generate the JWT token.

# Angular
In the front-end, I'm using Angular with modularization, NGRX, Guards e Auth.

# NX.dev
With NX I created some Angular Libs to maintain my application uncoupled.

# Flutter
As soon as possible, I'm starting to create mobile app with Flutter to consume the API.
